  Covers render states and permission gating. The fetch → diff → apply
  path itself is already covered end-to-end (with a stubbed HTTP
  transport) by `PhoenixKitEcommerce.Shopify.SyncTest` and
  `AdminClientTest` — `Sync.check/1` doesn't take a transport override,
  so exercising the live network call from here would just be a slower,
  less deterministic copy of that coverage.
