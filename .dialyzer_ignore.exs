  # Gettext.Backend expands into code that constructs %Expo.PluralForms{}
  # literals inline; that struct is @opaque in Expo, so dialyzer flags the
  # generated call to Gettext.Plural.plural/2 as a call_without_opaque
  # mismatch. Known upstream false positive (gettext >= 0.26) — the plural
  # forms work correctly. (Surfaced once et/ru plural translations were added,
  # which is when the backend emits the plural code path. Mirrors the same
  # ignore in phoenix_kit_staff / phoenix_kit_billing / phoenix_kit_catalogue
  # / phoenix_kit_projects.)
